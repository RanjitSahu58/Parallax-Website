        The Congolian rainforest is the world's second-largest tropical forest,
        after the Amazon rainforest. It covers over 500,000,000 acres (2,000,000
        km2) across six countries and contains a quarter of the world's
        remaining tropical forest.The Congolian forests cover southeastern
        Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, the northern and central
        Democratic Republic of the Congo, and portions of southern and central
        Africa. The Congolian rainforest is home to a large number of flora and
        fauna, including more than 10,000 species of plants and over 10,000
        species of animals. It is estimated that the region contains more than a
        quarter of the world’s plant species and is home to one of the world’s
        most threatened primate species, the western lowland gorilla.There are
        also a number of other species of primates, including the chimpanzee,
        black colobus monkey, red colobus monkey, and olive baboon.

        Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.

During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.

        Deep ecology is an environmental philosophy that promotes the inherent worth of all living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs, and the restructuring of modern human societies in accordance with such ideas.

Deep ecology argues that the natural world is a complex of relationships in which the existence of organisms is dependent on the existence of others within ecosystems. It argues that non-vital human interference with or destruction of the natural world poses a threat therefore not only to humans but to all organisms constituting the natural order.
